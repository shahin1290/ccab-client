                    <h3>Introduction</h3> 
                    <p>At CF College, our main priority is the well-being and education of our students and customers. It is of paramount importance to us that we do everything to ensure that our students receive the most effective course materials from our programs. One of the means of ensuring that our students get the information they need, in the most effective manner, is to view the visual journey that they take through our site. This, mixed with certain profile information, allows us to learn the in-site habits of our students. To do this, our website collects aggregate data and information from our website. As a result, we can offer a better user experience, better course materials, and better products.</p>
                    
                    <p>Below is CF College’s  Privacy policy. To make this content more readable, we have broken it into sections as follows.</p>
                    
                    <h2>What Type of Information do we Collect?</h2>
                    <p>There are three types of information that CF College collects.</p>

                   
                    <ul className="privacy-list">
                        <li>Collected information that is generated by our systems (or those of third parties) to track the traffic of our website. This allows us to tailor our marketing solutions.</li>
                        <li>Personal information such as; contact information (including, but not limited to, email) name, and occasionally billing details, financial and credit information (depending on whether you purchase a product through CF College).</li>
                        <li>Information that is given to us through surveys, subscriptions, etc.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                    <p>The type of information that CF College collects depends on the type of services that you opt for on our website, on the phone, through sales and in-person at Open Evenings or CF College external events.
                        In general, the information that we collect is not sensitive information. For example, we do not collect information regarding religion, sexual preference, race, or ethnic origin. Our purpose for collecting information is to provide you with a service or a product.
                        If it occurs that we require such information to supply a product to you, we will only request that information with your consent.</p>

                    <h4>How we use aggregate data</h4>
                    <p>CF College collects non-personal information as aggregate data like: how users utilize our website. For example, we monitor the number of visits to our site; we track the number of visits to certain pages on our site and the domain names of our users’ internet service provider.</p>
                    <p>This aggregate data allows us to examine trends and gather insights that would not be readable if the elements of data were viewed in isolation. It is a means that enables us to understand the workings of our website and services, and in turn, this allows us to improve and enhance our services. We may also use this data with our partners to improve our educational and employment services.</p>
